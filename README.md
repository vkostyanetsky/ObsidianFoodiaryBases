# Obsidian Foodiary (Bases) 🥪 🍎 🪵

This repo contains an example Obsidian vault that automatically calculates calories, protein, fat, carbs, and water — both for each individual meal and for the whole day. No more crunching numbers by hand.

Everything is built on plain Obsidian Bases, with a bit of automation from the Templater plugin.

## 🚀 Getting started

### 1. Install Templater

Enable community plugins in your vault and install [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater).

### 2. Configure Templater

> [!tip]
> The repo already includes a Templater [settings file](vault/.obsidian/plugins/templater-obsidian/data.json), so you'll probably be good to go out of the box.

Set the following options:

- `Template folder location` — choose the `Templates` folder
- `Trigger Templater on new file creation` — enable
- `Folder templates` — set up for two folders:
  - `Products`: `Templates/Product.md`
  - `Records`: `Templates/Record.md`

### 3. Create product cards

Product cards are individual notes where you store nutrition info for each food item.

Product properties (created automatically by Templater when you make a new file):

- `calories` — calories per unit
- `protein` — protein content
- `fat` — fat content
- `carbs` — carbohydrates
- `water` — water content
- `unit` — unit of measurement (`g`, `ml`, `piece`)
- `unit_size` — the size of the unit the nutrition is given for (for example, `100` for grams or `1` for per piece/serving)

If the product is measured in pieces, it's convenient to specify `unit_size` as `1` (see [example](vault/Products/Egg.md)). If it's measured in grams (see [example](vault/Products/Ham.md)), then use `100`.

> [!tip]
> In this example vault, product cards live in the [Products](vault/Products) folder, but you can keep them anywhere you like.

### 4. Log your meals

Each meal is a separate note in the [Records](vault/Records) folder. The easiest way to create them is by pressing `New` right in the [base view](Diary.base).

Meal note properties (also created automatically by Templater):

- `day` — date of the meal (auto-filled with today's date)
- `product` — link to the product card
- `quantity` — how much you ate (in the same units as in the product card; e.g. 2 pieces or 150 grams)
- `timestamp` — time / timestamp (used for sorting, auto-filled)

> [!tip]
> I use the [Meld Calc](https://github.com/meld-cp/obsidian-calc) plugin to quickly calculate net food weight (for example, subtracting the weight of a plate from the total).

## 👀 How to view your data

The [Diary.base](Diary.base) file has three configured views:

- **All** — all records for all time, grouped by day, with total calories/macros/water per day
- **Today** — only today's entries
- **Yesterday** — entries from yesterday

Open the base, switch views as needed, and you'll see your daily stats at a glance.

## 🛠️ How to customize it

Let's say you want to track fiber as well.

### 1. Add a property to product cards

Add a new property to existing product cards and to the [product template](vault/Templates/Product.md):

```yaml
---
calories:
protein:
fat:
carbs:
fiber:
water:
unit: g
unit_size: 100
aliases:
---
```

### 2. Add a formula to the base

Formula text:

```js
(
    link(product).asFile().properties.fiber
    /
    link(product).asFile().properties.unit_size
    *
    quantity
).round()
```

### 3. Add a column to the view

Add a column to the first base view using the formula you created in the previous step.

To see the sum for the new column, click its bottom area and select the `Sum` function.

> [!note]
> This is a custom summing function I wrote myself, because the standard one apparently can't be applied to columns whose values are generated by formulas.

That’s it — now just add a column to all relevant base views, and everything will work. Easy as pie — just don't forget to log it.
